# soda

This is a cli tool that can read an IDL and outputs the files needed for a basic Solana program and client code.

This is template based so you can create your custom building blocks.

Do you prefer a different client? the program code in other language? write a template and all your projects can generate from it.

#### Usage

`soda`: from ./idl.json generates code from default template
`soda <path>` from idl file or url in `<path>` generate project using default template

`soda <path1> <path2>` from idl file or url in `<path1>` generate project using template in `<path2>`
