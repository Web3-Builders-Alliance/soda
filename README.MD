# SODA: Ship a Solana program inferred from Solana data.

A tool for Solana development and audit that allows you to automate tasks and build Solana programs and clients from: IDLs, on-chain data, existing repos, input and output examples of each instruction, and naming conventions, among other possible resources.

### First Version Features

* **Generate Solana Program and client from IDL.**
* **Template based: create your custom building blocks.**
* **Compatibility with Anchor.**

## Getting Started

This is a tool that can read an IDL and outputs the files needed for a Solana program and client code. Current default template outputs an Anchor-Workspace and a NEXT.js, Typescript and Tailwind client.

Do you prefer a different client? the program code in other language? write a template and all your projects can generate from it.
