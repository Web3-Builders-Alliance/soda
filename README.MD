## Install Soda Desktop
  

To install the Desktop App you need to [download the lastest release](https://github.com/Web3-Builders-Alliance/soda/releases)

(Optionally you can download templates.zip file if you want to use other templates than the default one, or just clone this repo an use it from the templates folder)

**Provisional Steps:** We are still working in add code signing in our app so at this point a security warning probably will show up. Until we finish the code signing process you will need to check how to open the app in your OS.

## Install Soda CLI

You can install the CLI using cargo or npm.
- Using cargo (recommended):
```cargo install soda-cli```

- Using npm:
```npm i @use_soda/soda-cli -g```
